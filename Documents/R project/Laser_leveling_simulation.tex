Water scarcity and the efficient management of water resources have
emerged as major challenges in agricultural development worldwide. With
the increasing impacts of climate change, ensuring sustainable food
production has become a pressing concern. Irrigated rice cultivation
plays a vital role in ensuring global food security, providing a
substantial portion of the world's population with a staple crop
\textbf{(Bouman et al., 2007)}. Rice is a primary dietary staple for
billions of people, particularly in Asia, where it serves as a crucial
source of calories and nutrition \textbf{(Seck et al., 2012)}. Rice
consumption has increased globally over the last decade. Statista data
shows that, in the cropping year 2020/2021, the world population
consumed about 504.3 million metric tons of rice, increasing from 437.18
million metric tons in 2008/2009 \textbf{(Cuaton et al., 2022)}. To meet
the growing demand for rice and ensure stable food supplies, efficient
water management is essential. However, irrigated rice farming requires
significant water resources, accounting for a substantial portion of
global freshwater consumption \textbf{(FAO, 2020; Yang et al., 2006)}.
As water scarcity becomes an increasing concern, optimizing water use in
irrigated rice fields is crutial \textbf{(Molden et al., 2010).}

Irrigated rice fields play a crucial role in Vietnam's agricultural
landscape, providing sustenance for its population and contributing
significantly to the national economy \textbf{(Ngoc et al., 2012)}.
However, traditional manual leveling methods used in rice cultivation
are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often result in uneven water
distribution, leading to suboptimal crop growth and reduced yield
\textbf{(Tuan et al., 2014)}. To address these challenges, laser
leveling techniques have emerged as a promising solution for irrigated
rice fields. Here we enumerate some of the benefits of laser leveling,
its potential impact on agricultural productivity, and its suitability
for the Vietnamese context.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Improved Water Management: Laser leveling technology ensures precise
  land grading, creating a uniform surface with minimal slope
  variations. This accuracy allows for efficient water management and
  enables uniform distribution across the rice fields \textbf{(Nguyen \&
  Thang, 2019)}. By achieving a consistent water depth, laser leveling
  reduces water wastage, enhances irrigation efficiency, and minimizes
  the risk of both waterlogging and drought stress \textbf{(Ngoc et al.,
  2012)}.
\item
  Increased Productivity and Yield: Uneven land surfaces can hinder crop
  growth, leading to uneven maturity and reduced overall yield. By
  providing a flat and consistent terrain, laser leveling promotes
  uniform plant growth, facilitates optimal nutrient absorption, and
  ensures a balanced distribution of sunlight \textbf{(Tuan et al.,
  2014)}. These factors collectively contribute to increased crop
  productivity and improved rice grain quality.
\item
  Cost and Labor Savings: Traditional manual leveling methods are
  labor-intensive and time-consuming. In contrast, laser leveling
  technology automates the land grading process, significantly reducing
  the need for manual labor \textbf{(Nguyen et al., 2021)}. This not
  only saves costs associated with hiring and managing labor but also
  expedites the cultivation process, allowing for timely crop rotations
  and potentially increasing the number of planting cycles per year
  \textbf{(Hoang \& Vien, 2018)}.
\item
  Environmental Sustainability: Laser leveling helps mitigate negative
  environmental impacts associated with traditional cultivation
  practices. By optimizing water distribution, it reduces water
  consumption and minimizes runoff, preserving this valuable resource
  \textbf{(Ngoc et al., 2012)}. Additionally, by promoting uniform crop
  growth, it minimizes the need for excessive fertilizer and pesticide
  applications, thereby reducing chemical runoff and environmental
  pollution.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Decision analysis theory and

Decision analysis is a systematic approach for making decisions under
uncertainty, incorporating mathematical and analytical techniques to
evaluate alternative courses of action and their potential outcomes. It
is a quantitative approach that aims to support decision-making
processes by explicitly considering uncertainties, trade-offs, and
potential consequences.

The decisionSuppoty package developed by Eike Luedeling et al, provides
a systematic framework for making informed decisions based on a
combination of data, models, and stakeholder preferences. This R package
incorporates decision analysis techniques into a user-friendly software
tool, allowing decision-makers to analyze complex problems and evaluate
alternative courses of action. The methodology typically involves the
following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Problem Definition: Clearly defining the decision problem and
  identifying the objectives, constraints, and stakeholders involved.
  This step helps establish a clear understanding of the decision
  context.
\item
  Data Collection: Gathering relevant data and information related to
  the decision problem. This may include historical data, expert
  opinions, stakeholder preferences, and other sources of information
  required for the analysis.
\item
  Model Development: Developing mathematical or statistical models to
  represent the relationships between different variables and assess the
  potential outcomes of different decisions. The R package provides a
  range of modeling tools and techniques for decision analysis.
\item
  Uncertainty Assessment: Quantifying uncertainties associated with key
  variables or parameters in the decision problem. This may involve
  statistical analysis, sensitivity analysis, or the use of
  probabilistic modeling approaches to estimate the range of possible
  outcomes.
\item
  Decision Evaluation: Integrating the models, data and uncertainties to
  evaluate different decision alternatives. This involves comparing and
  ranking the alternatives based on multiple criteria, considering
  trade-offs and uncertainties.
\item
  Sensitivity Analysis: Assessing the robustness of the decision results
  by examining the impact of changes in assumptions, input data, or
  models on the recommended decision.
\item
  Communication and Implementation: Communicating the decision analysis
  results effectively to stakeholders and facilitating their
  understanding of the implications and trade-offs. This step helps in
  gaining consensus and support for the recommended decision and
  facilitating its implementation.
\end{enumerate}

The desicionSupport R package provides a comprehensive set of functions
and tools to support decision analysis using the R programming language.
It offers a flexible and customizable platform for implementing decision
support methodologies, enabling users to perform sophisticated decision
analysis tasks efficiently.

\subsection{Decision Criteria (maybe with Data
Sources?)}\label{decision-criteria-maybe-with-data-sources}}

Because our main objective is to determine whether laser leveling could
be applied by a small farmer rice cooperative in Vietnam or not, first
we decided to focus on the economic and ecological criteria of laser
leveling, as recommended by \textbf{Oertlé et al., 2019} since they
highlite the importance of introducing this not so well known topic so
far. They remark that is also important to demonstrate that this
technology could have an economic an environmental potential for
cooperative farmers. We know that we can implement this technology in
Vietnam because the goverment has runned the ``5 for 1 program'' to
promote sustainable rice production, which includes laser leveling as a
strategy. The following steps after this project would be to hold a
stakeholder dialogue to identify barriers and drivers for future
implementation.

For the model building process we determined first all the possible
variables for the economic and environmental components in our model and
design an input table, that is stored locally as~XXXXX.csv, this table
contains all the input variables and their values used in the model.

Economical Criteria cost-effectiveness potential yield improvement
(fertilizer savings, yield increase, seed savings)

Ecological (Water use savings, GHGE, soil conservation)
