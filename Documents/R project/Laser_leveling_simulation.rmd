# Introduction

Water scarcity and the efficient management of water resources have
emerged as major challenges in agricultural development worldwide. With
the increasing impacts of climate change, ensuring sustainable food
production has become a pressing concern. Irrigated rice cultivation
plays a vital role in ensuring global food security, providing a
substantial portion of the world's population with a staple crop
[@bouman_rice_2007]. Rice is a primary dietary staple for billions of
people, particularly in Asia, where it serves as a crucial source of
calories and nutrition [@seck_crops_2012]. Rice consumption has
increased globally over the last decade. Statista data shows that, in
the cropping year 2020/2021, the world population consumed about 504.3
million metric tons of rice, increasing from 437.18 million metric tons
in 2008/2009 [@cuaton_two_2022]. To meet the growing demand for rice and
ensure stable food supplies, efficient water management is essential.
However, irrigated rice farming requires significant water resources,
accounting for a substantial portion of global freshwater consumption
[@food__agriculture_organization_future_2018, @yang_water_2006]. As
water scarcity becomes an increasing concern, optimizing water use in
irrigated rice fields is crutial **[@molden_improving_2010].**

Irrigated rice fields play a crucial role in Vietnam's agricultural
landscape, providing sustenance for its population and contributing
significantly to the national economy [@ngoc_benefits_2012]. However,
traditional manual leveling methods used in rice cultivation are
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often result in uneven water
distribution, leading to suboptimal crop growth and reduced yield
**[@tuan_effects_2014]**. To address these challenges, laser leveling
techniques have emerged as a promising solution for irrigated rice
fields. Here we enumerate some of the benefits of laser leveling, its
potential impact on agricultural productivity, and its suitability for
the Vietnamese context.

1.  Improved Water Management: Laser leveling technology ensures precise
    land grading, creating a uniform surface with minimal slope
    variations. This accuracy allows for efficient water management and
    enables uniform distribution across the rice fields
    [@nguyen_application_2019]. By achieving a consistent water depth,
    laser leveling reduces water wastage, enhances irrigation
    efficiency, and minimizes the risk of both waterlogging and drought
    stress **[@ngoc_benefits_2012]**.

2.  Increased Productivity and Yield: Uneven land surfaces can hinder
    crop growth, leading to uneven maturity and reduced overall yield.
    By providing a flat and consistent terrain, laser leveling promotes
    uniform plant growth, facilitates optimal nutrient absorption, and
    ensures a balanced distribution of sunlight [@tuan_effects_2014].
    These factors collectively contribute to increased crop productivity
    and improved rice grain quality.

3.  Cost and Labor Savings: Traditional manual leveling methods are
    labor-intensive and time-consuming. In contrast, laser leveling
    technology automates the land grading process, significantly
    reducing the need for manual labor [@nguyen_evaluating_2021]. This
    not only saves costs associated with hiring and managing labor but
    also expedites the cultivation process, allowing for timely crop
    rotations and potentially increasing the number of planting cycles
    per year **[@hoang_benefits_2018]**.

4.  Environmental Sustainability: Laser leveling helps mitigate negative
    environmental impacts associated with traditional cultivation
    practices. By optimizing water distribution, it reduces water
    consumption and minimizes runoff, preserving this valuable resource
    [@ngoc_benefits_2012]. Additionally, by promoting uniform crop
    growth, it minimizes the need for excessive fertilizer and pesticide
    applications, thereby reducing chemical runoff and environmental
    pollution.

## Objective

The aim of this project is to determine whether laser leveling should be
applied by a small farmer rice cooperative in Vietnam or not.

# Methodology

Decision analysis is a systematic approach for making decisions under
uncertainty, incorporating mathematical and analytical techniques to
evaluate alternative courses of action and their potential outcomes. It
is a quantitative approach that aims to support decision-making
processes by explicitly considering uncertainties, trade-offs, and
potential consequences.

The decisionSuppoty package developed by @R-decisionSupport, provides a
systematic framework for making informed decisions based on a
combination of data, models, and stakeholder preferences. This R package
incorporates decision analysis techniques into a user-friendly software
tool, allowing decision-makers to analyze complex problems and evaluate
alternative courses of action. The methodology typically involves the
following steps:

1.  Problem Definition: Clearly defining the decision problem and
    identifying the objectives, constraints, and stakeholders involved.
    This step helps establish a clear understanding of the decision
    context.

2.  Data Collection: Gathering relevant data and information related to
    the decision problem. This may include historical data, expert
    opinions, stakeholder preferences, and other sources of information
    required for the analysis.

3.  Model Development: Developing mathematical or statistical models to
    represent the relationships between different variables and assess
    the potential outcomes of different decisions. The R package
    provides a range of modeling tools and techniques for decision
    analysis.

4.  Uncertainty Assessment: Quantifying uncertainties associated with
    key variables or parameters in the decision problem. This may
    involve statistical analysis, sensitivity analysis, or the use of
    probabilistic modeling approaches to estimate the range of possible
    outcomes.

5.  Decision Evaluation: Integrating the models, data and uncertainties
    to evaluate different decision alternatives. This involves comparing
    and ranking the alternatives based on multiple criteria, considering
    trade-offs and uncertainties.

6.  Sensitivity Analysis: Assessing the robustness of the decision
    results by examining the impact of changes in assumptions, input
    data, or models on the recommended decision.

7.  Communication and Implementation: Communicating the decision
    analysis results effectively to stakeholders and facilitating their
    understanding of the implications and trade-offs. This step helps in
    gaining consensus and support for the recommended decision and
    facilitating its implementation.

The desicionSupport R package provides a comprehensive set of functions
and tools to support decision analysis using the R programming language.
It offers a flexible and customizable platform for implementing decision
support methodologies, enabling users to perform sophisticated decision
analysis tasks efficiently.

## Decision Criteria

Because our main objective is to determine whether laser leveling could
be applied by a small farmer rice cooperative in Vietnam or not, first
we decided to focus on the economic and ecological criteria of laser
leveling, as recommended by [@oertle_potential_2019] since they highlite
the importance of introducing this not so well known topic so far. They
remark that is also important to demonstrate that this technology could
have an economic an environmental potential for cooperative farmers. We
know that we can implement this technology in Vietnam because the
goverment has runned the "5 for 1 program" to promote sustainable rice
production, which includes laser leveling as a strategy. The following
steps after this project would be to hold a stakeholder dialogue to
identify barriers and drivers for future implementation.

For the model building process we determined first all the possible
variables for the economic and environmental components in our model and
design an input table, that is stored locally
as Input_table_LL_decision.csv, this table contains all the input
variables and their values used in the model.

Economical Criteria cost-effectiveness potential yield improvement
(fertilizer savings, yield increase, seed savings)

Ecological (Water use savings, GHGE, soil conservation)

## Data Visualization

The simulated scenarios for the application of laser leveling visualized
using the `ggplot2` package [@R-ggplot2] -Time charts?

```{r data visualization, echo=TRUE}

## Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) analysis

Application of post-hoc analysis to `mcSimulation()` outputs

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(decisionSupport)

#select the 3rd outcome variable "NPV_LLL_added_value" from the mcSimulation results and run PLS simulation
pls_result <- plsr.mcSimulation(object = mcSimulation_results,
                  resultName = names(mcSimulation_results$y)[3], ncomp = 1)

input_table <- read.csv("Input_table_LL_decision.csv", sep = ";")
                        
plot_pls(pls_result, input_table = input_table, threshold = 0)

```

## Value of Information Analysis

Value of Information Analysis conducted using EVPI.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#here we subset the outputs from the mcSimulation function (y) by selecting the correct variables
# this should be done by the user (be sure to run the multi_EVPI only on the variables that the user wants)
mcSimulation_table <- data.frame(mcSimulation_results$x, mcSimulation_results$y[1:3])

evpi <- multi_EVPI(mc = mcSimulation_table, first_out_var = "LL_NPV")
#> [1] "Processing 3 output variables. This can take some time."
#> [1] "Output variable 1 (LLL_NPV) completed."
#> [1] "Output variable 2 (NO_LLL_NPV) completed."
#> [1] "Output variable 3 (NPV_LLL_added_value) completed."

plot_evpi(evpi, decision_vars = "LL_NPV")
#> Warning: There are no variables with a positive EVPI. You probably do not need a
#> plot for that.
#> 
compound_figure(mcSimulation_object = mcSimulation_results, input_table = input_table, plsrResults = pls_result, EVPIresults = evpi, decision_var_name = "NPV_LL_added_value", cashflow_var_name = "Cashflow_LL_added_value", base_size = 7)
