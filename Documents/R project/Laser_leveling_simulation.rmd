# Introduction

Water scarcity and the efficient management of water resources have emerged as
major challenges in agricultural development worldwide. With the increasing
impacts of climate change, ensuring sustainable food production has become a
pressing concern. Irrigated rice cultivation plays a vital role in ensuring
global food security, providing a substantial portion of the world's population
with a staple crop [@bouman_rice_2007]. Rice is a primary dietary staple for
billions of people, particularly in Asia, where it serves as a crucial source of
calories and nutrition [@seck_crops_2012]. Rice consumption has increased
globally over the last decade. Statista data shows that in the cropping year
2020/2021, the world population consumed about 504.3 million metric tons of
rice, increasing from 437.18 million metric tons in 2008/2009
[@cuaton_two_2022]. To meet the growing demand for rice and ensure stable food
supplies, efficient water management is essential. However, irrigated rice
farming requires significant water resources, accounting for a substantial
portion of global freshwater consumption
[@food__agriculture_organization_future_2018, @yang_water_2006]. As water
scarcity becomes an increasing concern, optimizing water use in irrigated rice
fields is crucial [@molden_improving_2010]**.**

Irrigated rice fields play a crucial role in Vietnam's agricultural landscape,
providing sustenance for its population and contributing significantly to the
national economy [@ngoc_benefits_2012]. However, traditional manual leveling
methods used in rice cultivation are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
result in uneven water distribution, leading to sub-optimal crop growth and
reduced yield [@tuan_effects_2014]. To address these challenges, laser leveling
techniques have emerged as a promising solution for irrigated rice fields. Here
we enumerate some of the benefits of laser leveling, its potential impact on
agricultural productivity, and its suitability for the Vietnamese context.

1.  Improved Water Management: Laser leveling technology ensures precise land
    grading, creating a uniform surface with minimal slope variations. This
    accuracy allows for efficient water management and enables uniform
    distribution across the rice fields [@nguyen_application_2019]. By achieving
    a consistent water depth, laser leveling reduces water wastage, enhances
    irrigation efficiency, and minimizes the risk of both water-logging and
    drought stress [@ngoc_benefits_2012].

2.  Increased Productivity and Yield: Uneven land surfaces can hinder crop
    growth, leading to uneven maturity and reduced overall yield. By providing a
    flat and consistent terrain, laser leveling promotes uniform plant growth,
    facilitates optimal nutrient absorption, and ensures a balanced distribution
    of sunlight [@tuan_effects_2014]. These factors collectively contribute to
    increased crop productivity and improved rice grain quality.

3.  Cost and Labor Savings: Traditional manual leveling methods are
    labor-intensive and time-consuming. In contrast, laser leveling technology
    automates the land grading process, significantly reducing the need for
    manual labor [@nguyen_evaluating_2021]. This not only saves costs associated
    with hiring and managing labor but also expedites the cultivation process,
    allowing for timely crop rotations and potentially increasing the number of
    planting cycles per year [@hoang_benefits_2018].

4.  Environmental Sustainability: Laser leveling helps mitigate negative
    environmental impacts associated with traditional cultivation practices.
    Optimizing water distribution reduces water consumption and minimizes
    runoff, preserving this valuable resource [@ngoc_benefits_2012].
    Additionally, by promoting uniform crop growth, it minimizes the need for
    excessive fertilizer and pesticide applications, thereby reducing chemical
    runoff and environmental pollution.

## Objective

The aim of this project is to determine whether laser leveling should be applied
by a small-scale rice farmer or rice farmer cooperative in Vietnam or not.

# Methodology

Decision analysis is a systematic approach for making decisions under
uncertainty, incorporating mathematical and analytical techniques to evaluate
alternative courses of action and their potential outcomes. It is a quantitative
approach that aims to support decision-making processes by explicitly
considering uncertainties, trade-offs, and potential consequences.

The decisionSupport package developed by @R-decisionSupport, provides a
systematic framework for making informed decisions based on a combination of
data, models, and stakeholder preferences. This R package incorporates decision
analysis techniques into a user-friendly software tool, allowing decision-makers
to analyze complex problems and evaluate alternative courses of action. The
methodology typically involves the following steps:

1.  Problem Definition: Clearly defining the decision problem and identifying
    the objectives, constraints, and stakeholders involved. This step helps
    establish a clear understanding of the decision context.

2.  Data Collection: Gathering relevant data and information related to the
    decision problem. This may include historical data, expert opinions,
    stakeholder preferences, and other sources of information required for the
    analysis.

3.  Model Development: Develop mathematical or statistical models to represent
    the relationships between different variables and assess the potential
    outcomes of different decisions. The R package provides a range of modeling
    tools and techniques for decision analysis.

4.  Uncertainty Assessment: Quantifying uncertainties associated with key
    variables or parameters in the decision problem. This may involve
    statistical analysis, sensitivity analysis, or the use of probabilistic
    modeling approaches to estimate the range of possible outcomes.

5.  Decision Evaluation: Integrating the model and data uncertainties to
    evaluate different decision alternatives. This involves comparing and
    ranking the alternatives based on multiple criteria, considering trade-offs
    and uncertainties.

6.  Sensitivity Analysis: Assessing the robustness of the decision results by
    examining the impact of changes in assumptions, input data, or models on the
    recommended decision.

7.  Communication and Implementation: Communicating the decision analysis
    results effectively to stakeholders and facilitating their understanding of
    the implications and trade-offs. This step helps in gaining consensus and
    support for the recommended decision and facilitating its implementation.

The decisionSupport R package provides a comprehensive set of functions and
tools to support decision analysis using the R programming language. It offers a
flexible and customizable platform for implementing decision support
methodologies, enabling users to perform sophisticated decision analysis tasks
efficiently.

## Decision Criteria

Because our main objective is to determine whether laser leveling could be
applied by a small farmer rice cooperative in Vietnam or not, first we decided
to focus on the economic and ecological criteria of laser leveling, as
recommended by [@oertle_potential_2019] since they highlight the importance of
introducing this not so well known topic so far. They remark that is also
important to demonstrate that this technology could have an economic and
environmental potential for cooperative farmers. We know that we can implement
this technology in Vietnam because the government has implemented the "One Must
Do Five Reductions" or 1M5R to promote sustainable rice production, which
includes laser leveling as a strategy. The following steps after this project
would be to hold a stakeholder dialogue to identify barriers and drivers for
future implementation.

For the model-building process, we determined first all the possible variables
for the economic and environmental components in our model and design an input
table, that is stored locally as *Input_table_LL_decision.csv*, this table
contains all the input variables and their values used in the model.

Economical Criteria cost-effectiveness potential yield improvement (fertilizer
savings, yield increase, seed savings)

Ecological (Water use savings, GHGE, soil conservation)

# Results

## Monte Carlo Simulation

The input table used is named *Input_table_LL_decision.csv* within this Rproject
folder. LL benefit ranges were lifted from Table 4 and 5 of
@nguyen-van-hung_precision_2022, divided by 5 since we consider yearly values in
this project, and not per 5-year period in contrast to the cited literature. We
consider 2 seasons per year since this is the recommended assumption in the same
literature, to maintain soil health and prevent outbreaks of rice diseases. We
work with 1 hectare field size for ease of comparison with literature later on.

```

## Data Visualization

The simulated scenarios for the application of laser leveling were visualized
using the `ggplot2` package [@R-ggplot2]. The code is shown below, as well as
the figures generated.

The density estimations of the NPV distribution plot of the Monte Carlo
Simulation model show in yellow (LL_NPV) the expected NPV distribution under the
laser leveling intervention scenario, and in lila (NO_LL_NPV) the scenario under
conventional production practices (without the intervention).

Because the 'do' LL_NPV scenario has a higher concentration of density with a
rightward trend in comparison with the NO_LL_NPV, it can be concluded that the
laser leveling intervention would have a higher positive impact on the farmer's
economy since the positive net present value represents that the rate of return
of the investment will be above the discount rate. 

The boxplot of the distributions of the 'do' LL_NPV and 'do not do' NO_LL_NPV
decision scenarios illustrate the spread of the data in a median (central line),
with 25th and 75th percentiles. So here we can see with a more detailed view,
how the median NPV values differ between scenarios, having the LL scenario with
a higher NPV than the business-as-usual scenario. 

The introduction of laser leveling in rice production in Vietnam seems to had a
positive impact on the Net Present Value (NPV) over a period of 25 years.

Further, it can be seen that the 'do not do' NO_LL_NPV scenario has a
concentrated density range between 50,000 USD and 170,000 USD, while in the 'do'
LL_NPV scenario has a distribution between 60,000 USD and 185,000 USD - a
right-hand-skew.

The maximum NPV with laser leveling LL_NPV is 245,320 USD, which is higher
compared to the maximum NPV without laser leveling NO_LL_NPV of 213,121 USD.
Similarly, the minimum NPV for LL is 54,757 USD, while for No LL, it is 53,758
USD. The mean NPV is 121,925 USD for LL and 107,581 USD for No LL. These
statistics suggest that laser leveling can potentially lead to improved economic
returns in rice production.

The NPV of the added value NPV_LL_added_value that laser leveling provides has a
maximum value of 101,462 USD and a minimum value of -62,091 USD. The mean
NPV_LL_added_value is 14,343 USD. This indicates that there can be instances
where laser leveling may not provide economic net benefits, as reflected by the
negative minimum value. However, on average, the NPV_LL_added_value is positive,
implying a positive impact of laser leveling on the added value in rice
production.

The outcome distribution vs density estimation graph, displays the estimated
probability density of a variable along with the observed distribution of
outcomes, in our case this graph reflects the difference between the NO_LL_NPV
and LL_NPV scenarios, where the x-axis represents the NPV while the y-axis
represents the estimated probability density. It can be seen that the curve is
skewed to the right, which indicates asymmetry and a higher distribution into
the LL_NPV scenario, which promotes laser leveling usage.

The cash flow over time plot, where the x-axis represents the duration of the
interventions, between 5 to 25 years in our case, while the y-axis represents
the magnitude of the cash flow, where positive values indicate incoming cash
flows (revenue, investments, etc.), and negative values represent outgoing cash
flows (expenses, payments, etc.). The blue line in the 25-75% quantile is
consistently positive and upward sloping, which indicates a positive cash flow,
where the mean cashflow is 489 USD and cashflow per year with laser leveling
Cashflow_LL_added_value has a maximum value of 7,056 USD and a minimum value of
-6,206 USD. These statistics indicate that the costs and benefits associated
with laser leveling can vary across different scenarios. However, the mean
cashflow is positive, suggesting a potential positive impact on the overall
cashflow in rice production.

Overall, these specific values reinforce the notion that laser leveling has the
potential to enhance economic viability and added value in rice production in
Vietnam. It is important to consider these specific figures along with other
factors such as cost-effectiveness, environmental impact, and long-term
sustainability when making decisions about the implementation of laser leveling
in agricultural practices.

## Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) analysis

Application of post-hoc analysis to `mcSimulation()` outputs.

```{r PLS analysis, echo=TRUE}
#select the 3rd outcome variable "NPV_LL_added_value" from the mcSimulation results and run PLS simulation
pls_result <- plsr.mcSimulation(object = mcSimulation_results,
                  resultName = names(mcSimulation_results$y)[3], ncomp = 1)

input_table <- read.csv("Input_table_LL_decision.csv", sep = ";")
                        
plot_pls(pls_result, input_table = input_table, threshold = 0)

```

## Value of Information Analysis

Value of Information Analysis was conducted using EVPI.

The Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP) analysis derived by
statistically relating outputs to inputs using PLS regression, shows colored
horizontal bars, where blue represents a positive impact and red a negative
impact. This figure indicates which input variables had the strongest influence
on the model outputs, in this case, the variables in red were: the rice yield in
conventional farming, part of the planning cost, maintenance cost, land use
savings, and the price of the rice, these variables. Further analysis of every
variable will be needed to understand its impact on NO_LL_NPV and  LL_NPV
scenarios.

```{r EVPI analysis, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
#here we subset the outputs from the mcSimulation function (y) by selecting the correct variables
mcSimulation_table <- data.frame(mcSimulation_results$x, mcSimulation_results$y[1:3])

evpi <- multi_EVPI(mc = mcSimulation_table, first_out_var = "LL_NPV")
#> [1] "Processing 3 output variables. This can take some time."
#> [1] "Output variable 1 (LL_NPV) completed."
#> [1] "Output variable 2 (NO_LL_NPV) completed."
#> [1] "Output variable 3 (NPV_LL_added_value) completed."

plot_evpi(evpi, decision_vars = "LL_NPV")
#> 
compound_figure(mcSimulation_object = mcSimulation_results, input_table = input_table, plsrResults = pls_result, EVPIresults = evpi, decision_var_name = "NPV_LL_added_value", cashflow_var_name = "Cashflow_LL_added_value", base_size = 7)

```

# Discussion

According to @galindo-prieto_variable_2014, VIP values greater than 1 point are
the most relevant variables, while VIP values below 0.5 are considered
irrelevant. According to our results in the VIP graph, rice yield is the
variable with more positive and negative impact with a higher value than 1 in
the blue and red bars. After multiple runs with different values, we found that
rice yield with and without LL are the variables worth investing to research
more on to make more informed decisions in our context. Farm size was not a VIP
in our runs, as were the VIP plot results showed by
@sapkal_impact_2019emphatized, where they highlight that LL is a scale-neutral
technology and is not biased towards farmers who own huge chunks of land.

By leveling rice fields, 20 - 40 % of water can be saved, and at the same time,
weed can be reduced by 40% due to more consistent water coverage, which results
in less pesticide use and excessive working hours [@van_nguyen_reporting_2019].

Consideration should be given to the scalability and replicability of the
application of laser leveling in Vietnam. According to
@nguyen-van-hung_precision_2022**,** the cost savings obtained from LLL
application were in the range of USD 1110--1331 ha−1 5 years−1, around 222 -
266.2 ha−1 yr; these values are consistent with our cash flow analysis, where
median value (blue line) in the 25-75% quantile goes around 489 USD. This
indicates that the potential for scaling up the implementation of laser leveling
technology across different regions and farming systems is promising. Also, this
introduces the implications that policies at the national or regional level,
that promotion of laser leveling technology, would be valuable. Creating a
holistic picture and understanding the broader economic, social, and
environmental impacts, as well as the necessary policy framework can guide the
integration of laser leveling into agricultural development plans and
strategies.

For this vision to work, exploring the challenges and barriers is essential to
the widespread adoption of laser leveling in Vietnam. This could involve
assessing the availability and accessibility of laser leveling equipment,
training, and technical support for farmers. As it stands, only a limited number
of companies provide laser leveling services, but the numbers are constantly
increasing [@van_nguyen_reporting_2019].

In addition to policy incentives, financial support from foreign or private
sources to encourage the adoption of this technology in Vietnam may benefit
locals, investors, and the environment likewise. Identifying potential
challenges early on was always what enables stakeholders to develop strategies
to overcome them and ensure successful implementation at a larger scale. This
may be what separates bad from great investors.

## Decision recommendation

Overall, the results highlighted that adopting LL is preferable in the context
of smallholder cooperatives in Vietnam compared to non-adoption in terms of the
costs and benefits taken into account in this study.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the Monte Carlo simulation analysis of laser leveling
intervention in rice production in Vietnam has demonstrated the potential
economic benefits and positive impact of this technology. The results indicate
that laser leveling has the potential to enhance economic viability and NPV in
rice production.

While there can be instances where laser leveling may not provide economic net
benefits, on average, it contributes positively to the added value and we showed
that laser leveling has the potential to generate improved economic returns and
higher NPV in rice production over a 25-year time frame for each hectare
leveled.

Additionally, we conducted an analysis of cash flow over time that also
indicated a positive impact of laser leveling on the overall cash flow in rice
production, thereby showing how the investments start to pay off from the first
year consistently, further supporting the potential economic benefits associated
with laser leveling.

Through the Variable Importance in the Projection analysis, several variables
have been identified as more or less important. These findings should be
carefully considered and analyzed in future studies and decision-making
processes.

Furthermore, apart from the economical perspective, there is also an ecological
perspective that should not be completely neglected as laser leveling comes with
beneficial and sustainable characteristics, namely reduced greenhouse gas
emissions and erosion, less need for agrochemicals such as fertilizer and
pesticides, as well as increased freshwater water savings.

However, we also addressed challenges and barriers to the widespread adoption of
laser leveling, including how to ensure the accessibility of laser leveling
equipment and providing training and technical support. Moreover, we noted that
it is important to raise awareness for this technology as the consideration of
policy incentives and financial support to promote it is necessary to implement
laser leveling at a larger scale.

In conclusion, the results from this modeling highlight the potential benefits
of laser leveling in rice production, creating a basis of insights for
decision-makers, especially small-scale farmers and farmer cooperation, to work
with. Our findings underline the importance of even more comprehensive research
on the impact of laser leveling, financial and political support, as well as
holistic thinking to fully explore the potential of laser leveling in
economically sustainable Vietnamese rice production.
